          I applied to OSC at the end of my first year, thinking there is no way I am capable of getting into this club. But miraculously, I got in for the interview and furthermore was elected as the secretary for the club.
          Then, the club became very close to me, and I used to love being a part of it. There were although ups and downs, with a lot of events, things not going as we wanted to be, but everything uaed to end in our favour.
          
          So, yeah it was pretty much it, 4 semester, 2 years of a roller coaster ride at OSC ðŸ˜‚"
